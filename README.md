# Meiosis-Tracer

**VERSION 4** - updated to work even after reloading the page.

**VERSION 3** - updated for latest Chrome, now with dark theme support.

**VERSION 2** - improved UI, can work with any stream, even outside of the Meiosis pattern;
no longer requires `meiosis` as a dependency.

Meiosis-Tracer is a development and debugging tool that traces, rewinds, and replays snapshots of
streams such as [flyd](https://github.com/paldepind/flyd) and
[Mithril Stream](https://mithril.js.org/stream.html).

You can also directly enter your own snapshots and send the values onto the streams. This works
particularly well in [Meiosis](https://meiosis.js.org) applications. Of course, Meiosis-Tracer also
works with Meiosis's
[Simple Stream](https://meiosis.js.org/docs/setup-js-stream-implementation.html).

You can use Meiosis-Tracer either by adding it to a page of your web application, or as a
[Chrome DevTools Extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/meiosis-tracer/lcomllmppaiciocfbeefdeoplnfpnnfl).

Please refer to the [Meiosis-Tracer Documentation](https://meiosis.js.org/tracer/index.html) for
all the details.
